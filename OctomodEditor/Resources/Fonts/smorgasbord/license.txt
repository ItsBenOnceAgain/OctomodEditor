"Smorgasbord", created using High-Logic Font Creator 7.0, is a Donationware font.

For usage, pick one or both of the following:

1. FOR ANY USAGE: Donate money to Andrew McCluskey via PayPal: nal@nalgames.com. I recommend the donation sum is what you feel the font is worth to you and what you feel is right for what you're getting from the font - I make less from doing this than you might think! 

2. FOR NON-COMMERCIAL OR NON-PROFIT USAGE: Donate as above, or just let me know that you're using the font, via email to nal@nalgames.com, with a tweet to @NALGames, or through DaFont directly! You don't need to attach any samples of the work, though if you can, it is highly appreciated, so thank-you. Just mentioning what you're using it for is preferred but not necessary. And you don't need a reply from me to get the okay, just use away!

This grants you, or the organisation/etc you represent, the ability to use this font infinitely for non-commercial/non-profit (option 2) or anything whatsoever (option 1). I do not restrict what you want to use it for, anything goes.

You may redistribute this font, but please let me know via nal@nalgames.com (I won't prohibit redistribution under any circumstance) and please include everything contained within the .zip folder the font was downloaded in.

For any queries, just email nal@nalgames.com with what you want to ask, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. If you can, please include the name of the font as well as the word "font" in the email title so I can prioritise a reply to it. Cheers.

Thank-you for downloading this font and I hope you find a use for it!
